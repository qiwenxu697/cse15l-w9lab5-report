# Week 7 Lab Report 4 - Vim 
## Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario 
1. Student: I get one test failed. It shows the second test has an IndexOutOfBoundsException according to "java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 3 out of bounds for length 3." Did I make mistake on increasing the index1 and index2? Is my logic of comparing the index to the list size incorrect? \\
2. TA: Hi. You logic is correct. According to your sceenshot, there is an IndexOutOfBoundsException in the second test. You can try to draw things out when you are merging {"a", "b", "c"} and {"c", "d", "e"}. You can try to check if you are putting too much elements into the list.
